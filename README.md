## About OpenFGA

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

It allows in-memory data storage for quick development, as well as pluggable database modules - with initial support for PostgreSQL.

It offers an [HTTP API](https://openfga.dev/api/service) and a [gRPC API](https://buf.build/openfga/api/file/main:openfga/v1/openfga_service.proto). It has SDKs for [Node.js/JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk), [GoLang](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk), [Python](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk) and [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk). Look in our [Community section](https://github.com/openfga/community#community-projects) for third-party SDKs and tools.

More SDKs and integrations such as Rego are planned for the future.
